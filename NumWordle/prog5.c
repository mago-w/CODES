/*INTRODUCTION - The program follows a structured flow to manage a number-guessing game.
 * set_seed first checks the user input and initializes the random number generator using a user-provided seed.
 * start_game then generates four random solution numbers (1â€“8) and stores them for comparison. 
 * The game progresses through make_guess, which takes user input, and extracts four guessed numbers, 
 * and compares them to the solution. It counts "perfect matches" (correct number and position) and 
 * "misplaced matches" (correct number, wrong position) using a series of conditional checks. 
 * If the guess is valid, the function prints feedback and increments guess_number; otherwise,it reports an error. 
 * 
 * 
 * The functions that you must write are defined in the header file.
 * Blank function prototypes with explanatory headers are provided
 * in this file to help you get started.

/*
 * set_seed -- This function sets the seed value for pseudorandom
 * number generation based on the number the user types.
 * The input entered by the user is already stored in the string seed_str by the code in main.c.
 * This function should use the function sscanf to find the integer seed value from the 
 * string seed_str, then initialize the random number generator by calling srand with the integer
 * seed value. To be valid, exactly one integer must be entered by the user, anything else is invalid. 
 * INPUTS: seed_str -- a string (array of characters) entered by the user, containing the random seed
 * OUTPUTS: none
 * RETURN VALUE: 0 if the given string is invalid (string contains anything
 *               other than a single integer), or 1 if string is valid (contains one integer)
 * SIDE EFFECTS: initializes pseudo-random number generation using the function srand. Prints "set_seed: invalid seed\n"
 *               if string is invalid. Prints nothing if it is valid.

//    "int seed" will contain the number typed by the user (if any) and the string "post" will contain anything after the integer
//    The user should enter only an integer, and nothing else, so we will check that only "seed" is read. 
//    We declare

//    If there is no integer, seed will not be set. If something else is read after the integer, it will go into "post".
//    The return value of sscanf indicates the number of items read succesfully.
//    When the user has typed in only an integer, only 1 item should be read sucessfully. 
//    Check that the return value is 1 to ensure the user enters only an integer. 
//    Feel free to uncomment these statements, modify them, or delete these comments as necessary.
